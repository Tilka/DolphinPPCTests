# Visual PPC CPU Tests

Just a little utility I use to test CPU instructions on Dolphin. Tested instructions visually display results on-screen.
This is still pretty rough around the edges, but it should be useful for anyone wanting to do tests in a quick visual way.

Some things still need to be done, such as printing out green/red for success/failure in terms of result checking,
however, it's fine in the meantime for visually comparing against hardware.

## Building it

1. Install devkitPPC
2. Just run make.
