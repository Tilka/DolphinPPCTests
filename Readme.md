# Visual PPC CPU Tests

Just a little utility I use to test CPU instructions on Dolphin. Tested instructions visually display results on-screen.
This is still pretty rough around the edges, but it should be useful for anyone wanting to do tests in a quick visual way.

## Building it

1. Install GRRLIB ([here](http://grrlib.santo.fr/wiki/wikka.php?wakka=HomePage)) into your libogc folder.
2. Just run make.
